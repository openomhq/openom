# openom

openom is a privacy-first family tree for desktop, mobile, and the browser: a
Rust core (`openom`, `journal`) and Tauri-based apps for the different
platforms (`apps`).

## Project status — PRE-RELEASE, ZERO USERS

openom has **not shipped**. There are **no production users and no production
data**. Design and review accordingly:

- **No data migration is ever required.** There are no existing trees to convert
  or preserve. "Migrate existing users", "coexistence with the old path", and
  "don't break existing data" are **non-issues** — do not raise them as blockers.
- **Breaking changes are free.** Wire formats, schemas, APIs, storage layouts, and
  crate boundaries may change without back-compat, deprecation, or a migration path,
  whenever there's a clear reason. Prefer the clean design over a compatible one.
- A clean breaking cutover is the default answer to "old vs new"; dual-path/back-compat
  machinery is almost never warranted pre-release.

(When this changes — first real users — update this section.)

## Commits

Use Conventional Commits with a scope on the enclosing directory. Imperative
mood, lowercase start, no trailing period.

- Structure: `type(scope): summary`
- Types: `feat`, `fix`, `chore`, `build`, `docs`, `refactor`, `test`, `perf`
- Scope: the component you touched, e.g. `app`, `store`, `server`, `tauri`,
  `preview`, `brand`, `docs`, `ci`
- Example: `fix(app): keep the search palette out of the re-rendered shell`
- Do NOT append a `Co-Authored-By:` / agent-attribution trailer (or any
  Claude/session line) to commit messages.

## Validation before committing

Run quick type checks, format checks, and unit tests after a series of commits.

**Clippy is a gate (`deny`).** `clippy::pedantic` + `clippy::cargo` are wired workspace-wide as `deny`
in `[workspace.lints.clippy]` (each crate opts in with `[lints] workspace = true`), so a finding FAILS
the build under clippy — CI runs `cargo clippy --workspace --all-features`. For every crate you touch,
run `node scripts/cargo.mjs clippy -p <crate> --all-features` and clear any finding before committing.
**Pass `--all-features`** — without it the feature-gated modules (`wasm`, `sqlite`, `profiling`, the
`test-util` gates) are not compiled, so a finding there stays invisible until CI. After a
`Cargo.toml`/dependency change, run one workspace-root pass —
`node scripts/cargo.mjs clippy --workspace --exclude openom-tauri --all-features` — which also catches
the project-file `clippy::cargo` lints. If a lint is genuinely wrong for a call site,
`#[allow(clippy::…)]` it with a one-line reason rather than reaching for a blanket allow.

## Code style

Prefer functions under ~150 lines. A longer one should be split into named phases or helper
functions — unless the logic is irreducibly coupled (shared mutable state that can't be cleanly
threaded across a call boundary), in which case say why in a brief comment. This is a guideline, not
a hard gate: a clear phase structure and readability matter more than the exact line count.

Reach for the type system to make errors impossible rather than merely caught. Newtype domain
values that would otherwise be interchangeable primitives (ids, keys, codes — a `TreeId` is not a
`ReplicaId`, a `Dek` is not a `Kek`), so a wrong-argument slip is a compile error rather than a
runtime error. At minimum, pure-Rust domain and public API boundaries must accept those newtypes and
secret wrappers directly; do not regress them to raw `&[u8]`/`&str` and reconstruct the type inside.
Convert raw values at external boundaries such as wasm, IPC, and serialization. Mechanism layers
may remain raw where appropriate, but may also use stronger types when that improves their design.

## Package & app documentation

Every crate in `packages/` and every unit in `apps/` has a `README.md`, wired as the module doc
(`#![doc = include_str!("../README.md")]` for crates). The format, the layer map, and the exemplar
(`packages/jcs/README.md`) live in `packages/README.md`.

When you add or materially change a unit:
- **The README is part of the code — keep it current.** Any change to a unit's behavior or contract
  updates its README in the *same* change; in particular, rewrite or **drop** invariants (and their
  prose) for behavior that no longer exists. A README that documents behavior the code no longer has
  is worse than none.
- Create/update its `README.md` — especially **What it is — and is not** (the scope boundary) and
  **Invariants** (the contract).
- Invariants are namespaced (`JCS-1`), stable, never renumbered, and each `verified by` names a
  **real** test. Never invent invariants to fill the table; a unit with no real contract has no
  Invariants section. A README may omit any section that would be padding — never pad one.
- Tag non-Rust code fences (` ```sh `, ` ```json `, …) so rustdoc doesn't run them as doctests.
- Keep the `packages/README.md` map and each `Position` line honest when the graph or a status changes.
- Verify before done: `node scripts/cargo.mjs test -p <crate>` (repo root; cargo runs under WSL2/Docker on Windows).
