# apps/src-tauri

> the Tauri v2 native shell — builds the desktop (Windows/macOS/Linux) and Android apps around
> `apps/app/`, wiring the shared Rust core to the webview through `#[tauri::command]`.

**Status:** built · thin wrapper crate, load-bearing (the only path to desktop/Android) · no
design doc of its own (wires `openom-vault-host`'s vault lifecycle + `journal`'s doc store to
Tauri)

**Last updated:** 2026-09-22

## Run / verify

Type-check only, from the repo root (Windows blocks native cargo build scripts here, so
`scripts/cargo.mjs` routes through WSL2/Docker automatically):

```sh
node scripts/cargo.mjs check -p openom-tauri
```

This crate has no `#[cfg(test)]` of its own, and `cargo test -p openom-tauri` is **not** the
verification path here — confirmed by running it: building a *test* binary pulls in Tauri's Linux
webview stack (webkit2gtk/gdk/pango), which the headless container `cargo.mjs` uses doesn't have,
and it fails at the `gdk-sys` build script (`Package 'gdk-3.0' ... not found`). `cargo check`
above succeeds because it stops short of that link step. The custody logic this crate wraps is
tested where it lives — `node scripts/cargo.mjs test -p openom-vault-host` — headless, no webview
needed.

Real verification is running the app. From `apps/`:

```sh
pnpm dev             # tauri dev — desktop window. Works directly unless this machine's
                      # build-script policy blocks a freshly-built cargo binary ("Access is
                      # denied (os error 5)") — see VERIFY.md Step 0; if it does, build under WSL2.
pnpm android:init    # one-time: generates src-tauri/gen/android
pnpm android:dev     # build + install + launch on an emulator/device — on Windows this needs
                      # WSL2 (native cargo is blocked); see WSL-SETUP.md for the full path
                      # (mirrored networking, Linux Android SDK/NDK, cloning into ext4).
```

Then work through the runtime checklist in **VERIFY.md** — provision/durability, change-passphrase
invalidation, tamper/rollback messaging, auto-lock, crash consistency, desktop and Android — it
isn't duplicated here. **WSL-SETUP.md** has the full Windows→WSL2 Android bring-up.

## What it is — and is not

The Tauri v2 native shell: it builds the desktop app and the Android app around the same
`apps/app/` web frontend and exposes the Rust core to it through `#[tauri::command]` invoke
handlers. Its managed `Arc<AppCoreHost<SqliteVaultStore>>` owns one unlocked profile account and all live tree
cores. The custody boundary is the reason this crate exists as a distinct native shell: account secrets and
tree DEKs remain inside Rust and **never cross the `invoke` boundary into the webview**. `vault.sqlite` stores
one revisioned account record with active and retained identity-scoped custody plus per-tree keyrings/watermarks, separately from each tree's local
blob directory so restoring tree data cannot silently roll back the custody floor.
The `account_status` command reports `none` / `locked` / `unlocked`; `account_lock` drops all live trees and
the resident account without deleting encrypted persistence. `account_snapshot` exposes only wrapped bytes
plus their Rust-authenticated generation/hash, while candidate-adoption commands pin the expected remote member id,
verify into temporary custody, retain displaced wrapped identity bytes, and persist before replacing the resident account. Sync-journal commands expose only non-secret record
metadata and atomically checkpoint auth binding, pending backup/revoke, and exact-version acknowledgement.

It is **not** where the logic or the tests live. Every `#[command]` here is a thin wrapper: it
(de)serializes arguments, runs account create/unlock/recover/passphrase changes as `async` + `spawn_blocking`
so the KDF does not freeze the Tauri IPC main thread, and calls straight into `openom-app-core-host`. Tree
provision, reopen, join, and membership operations borrow the resident account and never accept per-tree
passphrases or member KDF material. The substance — and the real,
cargo-testable contract — lives in those crates, which build without `tauri`; see
`packages/openom-app-core-host/README.md` for the custody guarantees this crate just wires up. This
crate also does not implement mobile hardening (mandatory background-lock, `FLAG_SECURE`,
hardware-gated biometrics) — that's the not-yet-built `openom-mobile` Tauri plugin (see VERIFY.md,
"Not yet built (Phase 2)").

## Invariants

None namespaced here. `src/lib.rs`'s own doc comment says why directly: this file "can't be
`cargo test`-ed in the headless container (the `tauri` crate needs system webview libs)" —
confirmed above — so it carries no test-backed contract of its own to table. The real, tested
custody guarantees (`VAULT-1`…`VAULT-8`: sessions fail closed after lock/clear, a rollback is
refused *before* a sealer is ever registered, change-passphrase/recover re-wrap the DEK rather
than rotating it, a remote keyring run is validated before being trusted, …) belong to
`openom-vault-host`; see `packages/openom-vault-host/README.md`.
