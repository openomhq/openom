# openom-docsync

> openom's binding of the generic `docsync` loop — seal local claim-op deltas to the store, merge peers' deltas back. Drives `docsync` over `openom-data-tree` (the claim engine) + `openom-sealer`.

**Status:** built · client orchestration, load-bearing · E2EE multi-device sync
**Last updated:** 2026-08-27

## What it is — and is not

It ties three layers that each deliberately know nothing of the others: `openom-data-crdt` produces and
consumes op batches (`ChannelItem`s); `openom-sealer` seals those bytes into E2EE envelopes; a
`store_log::DocStore` persists opaque envelopes as an append log. `SyncClient::push_claims` seals a
local batch and pushes it; `pull_claims` opens and merges every new log entry into the accumulated op
set; the engine's fold produces the live record set the projection reads; `compact_claims` /
`bootstrap_claims` publish a snapshot of the live set and load from one instead of replaying the whole
log.

A claim update **is** a delta — an op-based change — so it seals as a `Kind::Delta` /
`Format::OpenomOps` entry and is deduped by the replica dot like any other delta. **Single-engine-per-
app-instance:** the whole app runs the claim engine, so this client's log carries only claim entries —
no mixed-kind routing.

It is **not** the store: it holds no bytes of its own beyond an in-memory write-ahead queue of
already-sealed envelopes awaiting append, and all durability is the `DocStore`'s. It is **not** the
sealer: it holds no key material beyond the `Sealer` it wraps, and never inspects what the op bytes
mean.

## Invariants

| id | guarantee | why it matters | verified by |
|----|-----------|----------------|-------------|
| **SYNC-1** | Two replicas' concurrent pushes converge once each has pulled the other's entries. | The whole point of a CRDT sync loop: no reconciliation server, no delivery-order requirement. | `sync::tests::two_devices_converge_through_the_claim_stack` |
| **SYNC-2** | `pull_claims` past the last entry is a no-op. | Callers can pull speculatively or on a schedule without corrupting state or wasted work. | `sync::tests::pull_is_idempotent` |
| **SYNC-3** | A duplicate log entry (a retried append landing twice) folds in harmlessly, never double-inserting. | At-least-once delivery is assumed everywhere below this crate. | `sync::tests::a_duplicate_appended_entry_is_harmless` |
| **SYNC-4** | The set is not separately durable: a crashed client fully rebuilds it by replaying the sealed log alone. | The log is the durable source of truth; the in-memory op set is disposable. | `sync::tests::a_crashed_client_rebuilds_from_the_durable_log` |
| **SYNC-5** | Each batch is sealed exactly once; a transient append failure keeps it queued and retries the identical sealed bytes, never re-sealing. | Re-sealing on retry mints a fresh nonce under the same chain slot — a self-inflicted hash-chain fork. | (write-ahead queue in `push_claims` / `flush`) |
| **SYNC-6** | `bootstrap_claims` loads the snapshot plus only the tail after its `covers_through_seq` when one exists, and falls back to a full replay when none does. | A fresh device or a long-lived log never forces an unbounded replay. | `sync::tests::a_fresh_client_bootstraps_from_a_snapshot_plus_the_tail`, `sync::tests::bootstrap_without_a_snapshot_replays_the_whole_log` |
| **SYNC-7** | A moderator remove propagates and folds the record out of the live set (and out of a later snapshot — the structural GC horizon). | Deletion is a claim-model op, not a store operation; it must converge like any other. | `sync::tests::a_moderator_remove_syncs_and_drops_the_record`, `sync::tests::compaction_folds_out_removed_records` |
| **SYNC-8** | Opening a log sealed under a different DEK fails; it never returns partial or garbage plaintext. | E2EE: a wrong key must fail closed at the boundary this crate calls through. | `sync::tests::a_wrong_key_cannot_open_the_claim_log` |

Run: `node scripts/cargo.mjs test -p openom-docsync` (from the repo root; on Windows cargo runs under
WSL2/Docker).

## Usage

```rust
use store_blob::MemoryBlob;
use openom_data_model::envelope::Record;
use openom_data_crdt::ChannelItem;
use openom_crypto::generate_dek;
use openom_protocol::ids::{KeyId, ReplicaId, TreeId};
use openom_sealer::{Sealer, SealerSet};
use openom_docsync::SyncClient;
use docsync::Verdict;
use serde_json::json;
use std::sync::Arc;

let store = Arc::new(MemoryBlob::new());
let dek = generate_dek().unwrap();

let sealer_a = Sealer::from_unwrapped(
    1, dek.clone().into_inner(), TreeId::new(b"tree-uuid-16byte".to_vec()),
    KeyId::new(b"epoch-0".to_vec()), ReplicaId::new(b"replica-a".to_vec()),
);
let mut a = SyncClient::new("did:key:z6MkDevice", SealerSet::single(sealer_a), store.clone(), "tree", "replica-a");

let sealer_b = Sealer::from_unwrapped(
    1, dek.into_inner(), TreeId::new(b"tree-uuid-16byte".to_vec()),
    KeyId::new(b"epoch-0".to_vec()), ReplicaId::new(b"replica-b".to_vec()),
);
let mut b = SyncClient::new("did:key:z6MkDevice", SealerSet::single(sealer_b), store.clone(), "tree", "replica-b");

let person = ChannelItem::Assert(Record::try_from(json!({
    "id": "pA", "type": "openom.org/core/person/v1",
    "createdAt": "1970-01-01T00:00:00.001000Z", "createdBy": "did:key:z6MkA",
})).unwrap());

a.push_claims(&[person]).unwrap(); // sealed + written as a blob object
// Pull + fold, accepting every peer delta (the §B3 gate is the caller's classify — it returns the
// verified committer did:key alongside the verdict, which the fold judges op-authority against).
b.pull_verified(|_e, _p, _r, _c| (Verdict::Accept, "did:key:z6MkDevice".to_owned()), |_e, _b, _r, _c| {}).unwrap();

assert_eq!(a.live_records().unwrap().len(), b.live_records().unwrap().len());
```

Entry points: `SyncClient::new`, `push_claims` (edit + push) / `push_cover`, `pull_verified` (fold with the
caller's §B3 gate), `live_records` / `tree` (the read model + the wrapped `openom-data-tree` engine).

## Position

Sits above `store-log` (the opaque byte store) and `openom-sealer` (E2EE sealing), and drives
`openom-data-crdt` op batches through `openom-protocol` envelopes. Full dependency graph: see
`packages/README.md`.
