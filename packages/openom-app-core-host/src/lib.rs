//! The native (Tauri) host that runs [`openom_app_core::AppCore`] natively — DEK + engine + local device store

//! supplies the keyring or the floor: it FETCHES the keyring over the network (ciphertext), and the host
//! accepts and persists it (OPE-427 review fix 1 — ferry in the webview, accept in native). One `AppCore` per
//! doc, `Mutex`-guarded because Tauri dispatches invokes on a thread pool.
//!
//! This is plain, cargo-tested Rust; the Tauri `#[command]`s are thin wrappers over it (a later slice), which
