//! The `#[wasm_bindgen]` veneer over [`AppCore`] — the surface the Web Worker calls. Every method is
//! synchronous (the worker's async driver wraps them with `fetch`); the DEK lives in this module's
//! linear memory and never crosses to JS. The worker keeps a `Map<docId, AppCoreHandle>`; each handle
//! owns one tree's engine + sealer + local store + replicator.
//!
//! Marshalling: ids and sealed envelopes cross as `Uint8Array`; claim values and the read model as JSON
//! strings; the `u64`/`i64` cursors as range-checked `f64` (JS numbers). The flat argument lists are the
//! JS calling convention, hence the documented `too_many_arguments` allow.
