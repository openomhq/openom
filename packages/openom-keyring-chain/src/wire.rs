//! The chain keyring's **own** wire — hand-written `prost` messages the chain engine binds onto
//! `keyeo-chain`.
//!
//! Moved out of `openom-protocol` in OPE-300 so the chain crate owns its keyring shape
//! and depends on no openom proto crate (the same pattern `openom-keyring-api`'s `MembershipEnvelope`
//! uses). The field numbers/shapes are byte-identical to the former `openom.v1.Keyring` and sub-messages,
//! so semantics are unchanged.
//!
//! The DEK epochs and the recovery escrow's KEK wraps are NOT prost sub-messages: they carry keyeo's shared
//! key-material types (`keyeo_crypto::{Epoch, Wrap}`) as their canonical `codec` encoding inside `bytes`
//! fields, so both keyring engines share one key-material shape. The chain still owns the structural
//! envelope (`Keyring`/`Member`/`KeyringSignature`/`RecoveryKey` identity fields) as prost.
