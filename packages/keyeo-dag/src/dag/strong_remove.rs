//! `StrongRemove` resolver — a fixpoint over the op DAG that decides which ops to ignore.
//!
//! Three interacting rules, iterated to a fixpoint (the ignore set only grows, so it converges):
//!
//! 1. **Concurrent strong-remove.** A valid `Remove(M)` op `R` invalidates every op authored by `M`
//!    that is *concurrent* with `R` — so a member being removed cannot smuggle in ops during the
//!    concurrency window (e.g. adding an accomplice). Ops by `M` that causally precede `R` stay
//!    valid; ops after a valid removal are handled by rule 3 (the author is no longer present).
//! 2. **Mutual-remove tiebreak.** If `A` removes `B` and `B` concurrently removes `A`, both removes
//!    would invalidate each other. We process removes in a deterministic order — smaller
//!    `(lamport_depth, op_id)` first — so exactly one wins: the winner's remove stands and
//!    invalidates the loser's counter-remove. (A founder priority could layer on top later.)
//! 3. **Presence / accomplice cascade.** An op is invalid unless its author is *active* in the op's
//!    own causal ancestry — i.e. replaying that member's valid `Add`/`Remove` events that happen
//!    before the op (genesis members start active) leaves them active. So an accomplice whose only
//!    `Add` was itself invalidated (rule 1) is never present, and all their ops fall — transitively.
//! 4. **Remove wins over a concurrent re-add.** An `Add(M)` *concurrent* with a *surviving*
//!    `Remove(M)` is suppressed — an eviction wins the race against a re-add that does not causally
//!    follow it, so the outcome is decided by causality, not the Kahn/id ordering "lottery". An
//!    `Add(M)` that causally *follows* the `Remove(M)` is a legitimate re-onboarding and stands.
//!
//! Rules 1-3 are monotone and reach an inner fixpoint; rule 4 then suppresses re-adds against the
//! resolved survivor set and re-runs the inner fixpoint (a suppressed re-add can't re-establish its
//! member), all iterated to an outer fixpoint. Rule 4 gates on a *surviving* remove precisely so a
//! remove that rules 1-3 dropped cannot suppress anything.
//!
//! ## Design notes (validated against p2panda-auth, the upstream this is adapted from)
//!
//! **Mutual-remove semantics — ONE survivor, by design.** Rule 2's pairwise `(lamport_depth, op_id)`
//! tiebreak generalises to N-way cycles as **exactly one removal, not the whole cycle**: for a concurrent
//! `A→B, B→C, C→A`, keyeo removes a single member (the target of the surviving remove) and keeps the
//! rest. Upstream p2panda-auth instead removes *everyone* in the cycle (`AuthorityGraphs` + Tarjan SCC =
//! mutual destruction). We deliberately keep the one-survivor tiebreak: it's deterministic, convergent,
//! and strictly less destructive (a mutual-remove never empties a group). This divergence is verified
//! empirically by `two_party_mutual_remove_leaves_one_survivor` and
//! `three_way_remove_cycle_resolves_to_one_removal` (see `tests/integration.rs`). NOTE for the openom
//! consumer: mutual-remove cycles are *unreachable* under its signer-gate anyway (signer changes need
//! Owner/quorum; non-signers can't author removes), so the choice is moot there. p2panda's
//! `AuthorityGraphs`/Tarjan-SCC cycle-detection approach was deliberately NOT ported — if a
//! future consumer needs mutual-destruction (or delegation-aware quorum-conflict detection), it can
//! be added then.
//!
//! **Iterated fixpoint over single-pass-per-bubble.** Upstream (and localfirst/auth) resolve each
//! concurrency bubble in a single topological pass; keyeo iterates the rules to a monotone least
//! fixpoint over the whole op set. The fixpoint is chosen for verifiability: the ignore set only grows,
//! so the result is well-defined and **order-independent by construction** (proven by the BEC-convergence
//! proptest `resolution_is_order_independent`). At family-tree scale the extra iterations are free.
