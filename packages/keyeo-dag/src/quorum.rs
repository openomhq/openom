//! Generic multi-signer quorum — the domain-free core of v2 governance (see
//! `plan/design.keyring-quorum-v2.md`).
//!
//! A [`Requirement`] is a generic M-of-N over member ids; the
//! resolver counts DISTINCT approvers and asks the requirement whether quorum is met. Fail-closed: an
//! insufficient (or empty) approver set is never satisfied.
//!
//! Nothing here is membership-specific — `Requirement`/[`Requirement::satisfied_by`] are generic over
//! the id type, so this is the part of quorum that trivially fits a unified `Engine<Op, State, Resolver>`
//! (the coupling, if any, lives only in the `QuorumPolicy` that *produces* a `Requirement` from state).
