//! The engine selector (OPE-278).
//!
//! ONE enum both host consumers (the web-worker RPC in the `wasm` module and
//! the Tauri invoke host in `openom-vault-host`) dispatch through, so the chain-vs-dag choice is made once
//! here rather than hand-wired at 2 hosts × 2 engines — OPE-276's "write once".
//!
//! It implements the shared
//! client lifecycle [`KeyringLifecycle`] by delegating to the selected engine.
//!
//! The engine is a **deployment/backend preset** (owner decision 2026-09-03): the managed Lambda backend is
//! fixed to one engine, a BYO backend (Google Drive) to one — never a per-tree user choice. The choice is
//! resolved at RUNTIME, not a compile-time feature (revised 2026-09-02), so one binary can map different
//! backends to different engines: the host builds the right `AppVault` from config via [`Self::from_kind`]
//! and records the tag in its local head record; there is no per-tree engine discovery.
//!
//! Engine-SPECIFIC membership authoring (add/remove member, member-unlock, reseal) is deliberately NOT on
//! this trait — the chain and dag signatures differ (the chain needs a trusted-signer set + a scalar floor;
//! the dag does not), so each host dispatches those with its own `match` on the enum arm (OPE-277 gate).
