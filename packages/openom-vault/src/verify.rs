//! §B3 verify-on-ingest — the engine-NEUTRAL trust decision + a per-engine membership seam.
//!
//! On a shared tree, before a peer's delta is folded into local state, the client verifies it was
//! authored by a member who held the required capability in the keyring revision that governed it (see
//! [`crate::attribution`]). The *decision* (rev-0 / shared / hold / reject / accept — a faithful port of
//! the JS `entryVerifier`) is engine-neutral and lives here; only resolving an entry's governing
//! membership is engine-specific, behind the [`MembershipResolver`] trait. Chain implements it now
//! ([`chain::ChainMembershipResolver`]); the dag engine adds one more impl behind the same seam — nothing in the
//! neutral policy or the caller (`openom-app-core`'s `ingest`) changes.
