//! Engine-neutral retention / compaction vocabulary.
//!
//! Both keyring engines' histories grow (the dag's op-closure, the chain's retained revisions), and both
//! bound that growth the same way: a signed CHECKPOINT that carries the essential state forward, plus a
//! PRUNE of the history below it. This module is the shared surface for that:
//!
//! - the POLICY ([`RetentionPolicy`] / [`Retention`]) is pure `metrics → plan` — engine-agnostic, no
//!   position type, zero-cost;
//! - the MECHANISM ([`Compaction`]) is a FUNCTIONAL contract (no `&mut self`) each engine implements with
//!   its own state/position types.
//!
//! Why functional: openom holds each engine's serialized state as a blob and calls the engine per-operation
//! (the dag `resolve(anchor_bytes)`, the chain verify-fns over revision blobs); neither engine is a live
//! object. So `compact` takes the state by reference and RETURNS the compaction for the caller to apply — the
//! same shape for the CRDT dag and the linear chain, the model difference living inside each impl. The
//! `compact` IMPLEMENTATIONS carry the security bar (an authenticated checkpoint, pinned adoption, a
//! coverage-bounded prune) and land with the pruning slice; this crate defines only the contract + policy.
