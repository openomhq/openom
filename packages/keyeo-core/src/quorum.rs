//! Nothing here is membership-specific — [`Requirement`]/[`Requirement::satisfied_by`] are generic over

//! lives only in the `QuorumPolicy` that *produces* a `Requirement` from resolved state, which stays
//! engine-side). Fail-closed throughout: an insufficient (or empty) approver set is never satisfied.
