//! one-line import grep keeps `dag_vault.rs` free of `keyeo`).
//!
//! It mints content-addressed ops carrying an
//! opaque `sealing` payload, packages the trust anchor, and resolves an anchor to a [`MembershipView`] plus
//! the effective ops' sealing payloads for the vault's sealing fold.
//!
//! The anchor is the same trust state the keyless [`crate::verifier`] uses — pinned founding config + the

//! resolver-inert per OPE-271, so it is pinned to always contribute its sealing).
