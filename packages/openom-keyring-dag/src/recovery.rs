//! Recovery-key derivation for the DAG keyring (OPE-269).
//!
//! The **Recovery Verification Key (RVK)** is the Ed25519 key that authorizes a `ReFound` (recovery
//! re-founding) op. It is derived from the escrowed **Recovery Root Key (RRK)** secret via HKDF-SHA256
//! under a dedicated info label — DOMAIN-SEPARATED from every other key the same secret might derive, so
//! the signing capability the RVK grants can never be confused with an encryption or identity key (never
//! reuse a scalar across roles). Anyone who can unwrap the RRK secret (via the passphrase or the recovery
//! code) can derive the RVK and sign a `ReFound`; nobody else can.
//!
//! `rvk_public` is pinned in the signed genesis, so every replica can verify a `ReFound` at admission
//! against the recovery authority the group was founded with — strictly stronger than the linear chain's
//! `verify_reset`, which accepts any self-signed reset and rests entirely on an out-of-band ceremony.
//!
//! This is the crypto primitive only; the `ReFound` op, its pinning, and the merge semantics land in the
//! following OPE-269 slices.

/// The frozen HKDF domain label for the recovery-verification key. Byte-identical to the chain's
/// (`openom_crypto::derive_rvk`), so a tree provisioned by either engine pins the same RVK from the same
/// secret — an openom-vault cross-check test guards the two copies against drift.
