**openom** is a **local-first, end-to-end-encrypted family tree**. One Rust core runs everywhere — a
desktop/mobile app (Tauri) and a buildless web app — and syncs through a **zero-knowledge** server that
only ever stores opaque encrypted blobs. Your genealogy, your keys, your device.

**The name.** *openom* is **open** + **ኦም** (*om*), which is "tree" in Tigrinya, a language of the Tigray 
Region of Ethiopia and of Eritrea. An open, local-first family tree.

- **Local-first** — the tree lives on your device and works offline; the server is a sync relay, not the source of truth.
- **Zero-knowledge** — the client seals every tree before upload; the server holds ciphertext + non-secret metadata, never a key.
- **One core, three shells** — the same Rust engine drives desktop, Android/iOS, and the browser; no second implementation.
- **Buildless web** — `apps/app/` is ES modules the browser loads directly; nothing is bundled. Edit, reload, done.
- **CRDT + real sharing** — an op-based CRDT converges edits across devices; a signed keyring gives role-based sharing (Viewer → Owner).

> **Status: prototype.** The architecture, crypto, sync, and sharing are built and tested; persistence and UX polish are ongoing.

## Concept

openom treats a family tree as a **local-first, end-to-end-encrypted document**. The client is the
stateful, key-holding side; the server is stateless and keyless — it stores only opaque sealed blobs and
non-secret metadata, and can never read a tree. Trust lives on the device, not in the backend.

State is a **log, not a row**. Edits are self-contained CRDT operations appended to a sealed, append-only
log; the visible tree is derived by replaying that log (with snapshots for speed). Because the operations
commute, independent devices converge without a merge server — the backend only relays bytes it cannot read.

The engine is **one Rust core**, compiled native for the desktop/mobile shell and to WebAssembly for the
browser, behind narrow, swappable seams: a content-agnostic store, a domain-agnostic CRDT, a family-tree
layer on top, a sealer that is the sole holder of keys, and a signed keyring that makes sharing and roles a
client-verified guarantee rather than a server promise.

## Running it

pnpm commands run from `apps/`.

```powershell
pnpm install
pnpm serve   # web app on http://localhost:5173 (store = IndexedDB)
pnpm dev     # tauri dev — desktop window (store = native SQLite)
```

There is no build chain for the web app: `pnpm serve` is a tiny static server (`scripts/serve.mjs`) that
exists only because `file://` blocks ES modules in some browsers. Tauri serves the same `apps/app/` folder —
one app, two shells.

## Continuous integration

| Workflow | Runs on | Answers |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `web.yml` | push to `main` / PR | Do all modules parse, error codes stay in sync, locales complete, and no `.stack` leak into the UI? (seconds, no toolchain) |
| `desktop.yml` | push to `main` / PR / manual | Clippy gate (runs first, blocks the matrix), then the Tauri build on Windows/macOS/Linux + the store-conformance suite (MemoryStore ≡ SqliteStore) |
| `integration.yml` | push to `main` / PR / manual | The server contract suite (`openom/tests/api.rs` + storage checksum) against a live Postgres + MinIO — the `#[ignore]`d tests the unit jobs skip |
| `pages.yml` | manual | Publishes the web app to GitHub Pages |
| `mobile.yml` | manual / weekly ×2 (Mon + Thu) | Android APK + unsigned iOS-simulator build (unsigned `--debug` build-check artifacts — the SDKs are slow, no signing pipeline yet) |
| `mutants.yml` | manual / weekly (Mon) | Mutation testing (`cargo-mutants`) over the security-critical crypto/keyring/CRDT crates + the pure-core crates — surfaces test gaps a green suite hides |

## Brand

`assets/` (repo root) is the single source of truth for the mark — wordmark, monogram, app icon, favicon,
and the social previews — shared by the web app (served at `/assets`), the docs, and GitHub. The Tauri shell
generates its own `apps/src-tauri/icons/` from `assets/icon.svg`.
