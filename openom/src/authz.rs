//! Tree authorization — the ONE place "may this member do this to this tree?" is decided.
//!
//! The authoritative membership/role lives in the client-verified signed keyring; `tree_access` is a
//! DERIVED, advisory server ACL — defense-in-depth + cost-control, never the security boundary (a
//! malicious server can edit a row but can't forge a signature or decrypt). Handlers resolve the owner
//! they already need and call [`authorize`]; this is the single point B3 widens from single-owner to
//! role-based, and the only place the endpoint→capability→role policy lives.
//!
//! Roles are numeric, power descending (owner strongest), so a gate is `member_role <= required`.
