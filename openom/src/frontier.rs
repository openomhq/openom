//! Seen-frontier report — plumbing for the future log-GC floor
//! (`plan/sync/design.ope398-managed-server.md` §4, build-order step 5).
//!
//! `PUT` lets a member advisorally report its own `BlobSyncClient::frontier()` (what it has
//! PULLED/FOLDED so far) per replica; `GET` (Administer-gated) reads the raw reports back. The worker
//! reports on every sync tick whose pull frontier advanced (`appCore.worker.js` `syncData`).
//!
//! This is now the **gate-2 (liveness) input** to the two-gate log-GC floor: `gc::mark_tree` takes, per
//! replica, the MIN reported frontier over the current members who reported inside the activity window, and
//! the floor is `max(gc_floor, min(gate1_covered, gate2_seen))` (see `gc.rs`). So a member's un-pulled log
//! tail is never reaped from under it while it stays active; a member silent past the window drops out of
//! the min and must re-bootstrap from the snapshot instead (safe — the snapshot's covered frontier is the
//! gate-1 safety input). These reports are advisory and client-asserted, never authoritative: over-claiming
//! only pins THIS member's own floor higher (it can't force deletion), the same trust model as `access.rs`'s
//! membership summary.
